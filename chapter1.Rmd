This course is exactly what I am looking for. I was trying to find a data science course that use R to solve problems at bot Aalto University and University of Helsinki, then I came across this course: Introduction to Open Data Science. I hope to achieve more things during the course. Thank you!

Please have a look at my Github Repository.
